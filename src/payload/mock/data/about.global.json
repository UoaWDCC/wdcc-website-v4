We run projects with real-world clients that solve real-world problems, generally for NFP organisations or other student clubs who don't have the funding to fund a solution themselves.\n\nProjects could also be to develop own open-source tools to better support the development community. To help our members and the wider student community improve their skills and gain more benefits from the projects, we also hold workshops that help to upskill.",
