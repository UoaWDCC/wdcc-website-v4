Our current tech stack consists of Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, Drizzle and NextAuth. The current issue that UABC faces is when members go to book a session for the upcoming week, it is all done through google forms which is a time consuming and extensive process. Our project aims to solve this by creating a web app where existing members can log in and book their sessions, creating a streamlined process. On top of this, UABC execs are also able to keep track of individual sessions and view/edit the semester schedule.",

                "Every year, the University of Auckland Formula SAE Team, F:SAE:47, assembles a team of 70 to 80 UoA students to design and build a race car that will compete in the Melbourne-based FSAE-Australasia competition.\nBuilding a high-performance race car requires a lot of dedication, resources and support and thus, behind the F:SAE:47 club's success lies a strong network of sponsors, benefactors, and alumni. Over the years, these supporters have consistently expressed interest in hiring from the F:SAE:47 pool of talented students. To streamline this process, the club has tasked the WDCC with developing a Job Board application which would bridge the gap between their sponsors and alumni seeking to recruit top talent, and the F:SAE:47 members actively seeking internships and job opportunities.\nAs a team of 10 web development enthusiasts, we have been working very hard these past 6 months to bring their vision to life! Meet our fantastic team of dedicated software developers: Danny, Don, Frank, Jack, Jaehoon, Jolin, Josef, Kinzi, Sienna, and Yang.",
