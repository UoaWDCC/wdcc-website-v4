We use money from sponsors to eat food and share food and talk to other clubs and do collaborations and hackathons and consulting competitions occasionally. But we also help other clubs and whatever random clients approach us by doing web development projects for them. \nAnd the best part is: that we recruit university students to do this for free because they literally need experience.",
